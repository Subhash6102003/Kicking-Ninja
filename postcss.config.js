// This configuration file sets up PostCSS to use Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer.
// It ensures that Tailwind's utility classes are generated and that vendor prefixes are added for better browser compatibility.
// The file is essential for processing CSS in projects that use Tailwind CSS, allowing for custom styles and responsive design features.
// The PostCSS configuration is typically used in conjunction with a build tool like Webpack or Vite to process CSS files.
